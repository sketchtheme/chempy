Combination Reactions (Synthesis): 
    Two or more reactants combine to form a single product. 
    Example: A + B → AB

Decomposition Reactions: 
    A single reactant breaks down into two or more products. 
    Example: AB → A + B

Single Replacement Reactions: 
    An element displaces another element in a compound, 
    resulting in the formation of a new compound and a free element. 
    Example: A + BC → AC + B

Double Replacement Reactions: 
    Positive ions in two compounds switch places, 
    resulting in the formation of two new compounds. 
    Example: AB + CD → AD + CB

Combustion Reactions: 
    A substance reacts rapidly with oxygen to produce heat and light. 
    Commonly observed in reactions involving hydrocarbons and oxygen.

Redox Reactions (Oxidation-Reduction): 
    Involves the transfer of electrons between reactants. 
    One substance is oxidized (loses electrons), 
    and another is reduced (gains electrons).

Acid-Base Reactions: 
    Involves the transfer of a proton (H+ ion) from an acid to a base, 
    resulting in the formation of water and a salt.

Precipitation Reactions: 
    Two aqueous solutions react to form an insoluble solid (precipitate) 
    and an aqueous solution.
