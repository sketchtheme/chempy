    First, determine all the unique elements involved in the reaction. 
    You've already done this in your parseReaction function, and you've stored them in the unique set.

    Create a variable (vector) for each unique element. 
    These variables will represent the coefficients of each element in the balanced equation. 
    Let's call these variables x, y, z, t, etc. You can use the same set unique to define these variables.

    Set up equations based on the conservation of each element. 
    For each element, the sum of its coefficients in the reactants should equal the sum of its coefficients in the products. 
    You can write these equations as follows:

        For element A: x * reactant_A + y * reactant_B + ... = t * product_A + u * product_B + ...

        Repeat this equation for each element present in the reaction.

    Now you have a system of linear equations. 
    You can represent this system in matrix form Ax = b, 
    where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables (coefficients), 
    and b is the vector on the right-hand side of the equations.

        A is a matrix where each row corresponds to one of the conservation equations.
        x is the vector of variables (coefficients for each element).
        b is a vector where each element is the difference between the sum of coefficients in the products 
        and the sum of coefficients in the reactants for each element.

    Now you can use Gaussian elimination (or any other method) to solve the system of equations 
    Ax = b to find the coefficients (x, y, z, t, etc.) that balance the reaction.
